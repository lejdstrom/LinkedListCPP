# LinkedList Project

The LinkedList project is a simple implementation of a linked list data structure in C++. It provides basic operations for manipulating a linked list, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Features

- Insertion of elements at the beginning or end of the list
- Deletion of elements from the list
- Searching for an element in the list
- Displaying the elements of the list
- Checking if the list is empty

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- GNU Make (optional, for easy compilation using the provided Makefile)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the source files using the provided Makefile:

Alternatively, you can manually compile the source files using your preferred C++ compiler.

4. Run the executable:

./LinkedListTest

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `LinkedList.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the LinkedList class.
- `LinkedList.cpp`: Source file containing the implementation of the LinkedList class.
- `LinkedListTest.cpp`: Source file containing the main function and test cases.
